GSI (FHEM)

GSI shows the share of renewable energies in the power grid for any location in Germany at the current time and a forecast for the next 24 hours. At the same time, Co2 emissions for generation are displayed. Co2 values for the regular electricity mix and Co2 values for tariffs with 100% renewable energy are available.

In addition, based on the prediction of the electricity composition, the energy consumption can be planned for periods with a high proportion of renewable energies and thus low Co2 emissions.

The energy forecasts are provided by 'corrently', in cooperation with the network operators, based on the network topology and weather forecasts.

        The icon will be colored based on share of renewable energy (GSI) available:
            0..39: black
            40..59: orange
            60..100: green

    Consumption schedule
        The prediction (forecast) can be used to automatically control electrical consumers based in the amount of renewable energy expected:
            define name at {GSI::greenPower('name_of_gsi_device',2,18)} set consumer on-for-timer 720

        This example requests the 2 consecutive hours with the highest share of renewable energy within the next 18 hours. This is used for the definition of an 'at'   which switches on a consumer for 2 hours (720 seconds) at the best possible time.
